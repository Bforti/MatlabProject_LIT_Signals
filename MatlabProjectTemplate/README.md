# MatlabProjectTemplate documentation

This directory contains documentation and tools for the MatlabProjectTemplate template repo itself. (This is the tool that was used to generate the skeleton for this project.)

You can ignore this stuff if you want, or even delete it: it is not required for the project to function properly. But you probably want to read the stuff in here, and maybe keep it around. It contains useful information!
