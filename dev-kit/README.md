# __myproject__ Dev Kit

This directory contains tools for doing development on __myproject__ itself. It is for use by the developers of __myproject__, and is not for use by users of it, and does not ship with the project distribution.

__myproject__ developers should add this directory to their Matlab path when working on the project.
