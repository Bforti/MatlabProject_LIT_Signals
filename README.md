# <myproject>

This is a template repo for creating Matlab library and application projects.

## MatlabProjectTemplate Template Usage

To create a new project from this template, go on GitHub, create a new repo, and select this repo as its template.

Then:

* Add a license file!
* Put your main Matlab source code in `Mcode/`
* Put your example scripts in `examples/`
* Edit `.editorconfig` to reflect your preferred code style
* Edit the files in `doc-project` to reflect your plans
* Choose a document format: Jekyll, Asciidoc, or mkdocs. Move the appropriate `doc-src-<type>` to `doc-src` and delete the others.

TODO for apjanke: Write a project initialization script that takes care of all the initial repo editing steps that can be automated.
