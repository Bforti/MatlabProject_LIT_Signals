# MatlabProjectTemplate documentation

This directory contains documentation and tools for the MatlabProjectTemplate template repo itself. (This is the tool that was used to generate the skeleton for this project.)

You can ignore this stuff if you want, or even delete it: it is not required for the project to function properly. But you probably want to read the stuff in here, and maybe keep it around. It contains useful information!

## Publishing to MathWorks File Exchange

MatlabProjectTemplate _strongly_ recommends that you publish your project to File Exchange by linking your File Exchange post to your GitHub repo, and using their new Release-driven linkage. (This is what File Exchange themselves recommend, too.)

## About MatlabProjectTemplate
